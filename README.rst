ROI Buddy GUI
*************

Introduction
============

The ROI Buddy GUI can be used for viewing, creating, editing, and tagging the
regions of interest (ROIs) associated with multiple SIMA imaging datasets
simultaneously.
In addition it can be used for registering ROIs from different imaging
sessions of the same field-of-view, allowing for the longitudinal tracking of
cells in serial imaging experiments.
